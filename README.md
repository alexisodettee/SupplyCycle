<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

<br />

**Supply Cycle** is a software that contains a comprehensive toolkit that guarantees transparency, trust, and traceability for supply chain operations focused on NGOs and companies.

# The Problem Supply Cycle Solves

We know how complicated it is to verify and secure all the processes behind the supply chain regarding funds and donations to confirm that whatever you sent actually got to the place you meant to send it. This situation also applies to companies that work day by day towards their traceability and reputation.

**Supply Cycle** eliminates every uncertainty around these transactions by making them 100% transparent and traceable for both our donors and beneficiaries through smart contracts, attestations, and a mechanism to reward actors in the ecosystem that collaborate efficiently, enhancing our reputation system.

Companies will also benefit from this service in different areas at any time.

# Challenges We Ran Into

The main challenge we faced was to successfully activate our smart contracts while including attestations and developing live delivery tracking through QR codes for every stakeholder involved in the process. Additionally, we aimed to follow a simple user design for our web development that effectively communicates our main product.

# How it Works

Our app starts at the donation center, where goods are received and logged into the blockchain. This ensures that every item is accounted for from the very beginning, providing a transparent record of all donations.
Delivery Bus

As goods are transported, our app tracks their movement in real-time. Delivery personnel can easily update the status of shipments, ensuring that all stakeholders have up-to-date information on the location and condition of the goods.

At distribution centers, our app facilitates efficient inventory management and allocation of resources. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of how goods are distributed.
Aid Recipients

Finally, our app tracks the delivery of aid to recipients. This last step completes the chain of custody, providing a full picture of how donations are used and ensuring that they reach those in need.
